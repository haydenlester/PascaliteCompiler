Compiler for Pascalite, a simple programming language based on Pascal syntax, though reasonably complex and capable of recognizing and executing ```if```, ```while```, ```repeat```, and more.

Runs on *nix, NASM code utilizes ```Along32.inc``` and will not assemble without it

Please see test cases in ```PascaliteCompiler/testdata``` for sample input and output files

Please see documentation in ```PascaliteCompiler/documentation``` for more information on syntax and the compiler's overall structure
